							<span class="time">Hi there,</span>
							<br />

							My name is Sophia Oladapo.

							<br />

							I am a thirteen year old storytelling copywriter that uses stories to generate and increase sales for marketing coaches and video editors.

							<br />

							<br />

							I have been changing lives, sharing content and writing copy on my social media accounts, status and newsletter for five months now.

								<br />

								In the past 5 months that I have been a copywriter (mostly doing landing pages) I haven't been so good at writing copy compared to the many experts around me.

								<br />

								<br />

								I loved creating stories like the one I used to read in my childhood, so I decided to start creating business stories and I called one of them "Eggie The MoneyMaster".

								<br />

								<br />

								It is a story series that explains many hard business concepts and ideas using the main actor of the story - Eggie.

								<br />

								<br />

								As the months went by, I finally realized that I was more good at writing fictional stories used in copy than the copy itself.

								<br />

								After this revelation I changed my focus from just being a copywriter to a copywriter that creates interesting fictional stories(that is they are not true life stories)used in the hook of a copy.

								<br />

								<br />

								The first time I created a WordPress site was in 2021, it was a blog where I shared my testimonies of how God provided for and protected me and my family in our sad times when we prayed to Him.

								<br />

								<br />

								After I met with the founder of a famous Health Brand, I helped him to create a website for his brand using wordpress.
								I also managed his site for him, if you'd like to see the site click

							<div class="content-2">
								<span class="content-3">Strategising Sessions</span>
								<br />

								I organize strategy sessions where I do a screening of your business, cross check for mistakes or hidden problems that limit the sales or growth of your business and create solutions for them.

								<br />

								<br />

								Click the button below if you like the thought of getting rid of all those ugly problems that limit your sales.

								<span class="content-3">Brand Naming</span>
								<br />

								The importance of a brand name can't be over-talked about.
								It what makes you able to recognise Pepsi by simply seeing the name and know its difference from Coca Cola.

								<br />

								<br />

								In 2021, a woman in the body cream industry met me and she was worried because of her brand name was not sounding good and one of her clients wanted the name changed because of how it sounded.

								<br />

								<br />

								She almost lost the job because of her brand name if not because she took quick action and came to meet me for help.

								<br />

								After I heard and understood her, I asked her some questions and afterwards I and my graphic designer started brain storming, researching and creating different business name she could use.

								<br />

								<br />

								At the end of the day, we finally got a name that was not already taken and had a meaning. The name is Mavix Glow.

								<br />

								<br />

								The MA was taken from her traditional name,

								<br />

								The VIX was a tweaking of the word VIC- another part of her english name.

								<br />

								<br />

								The glow was used to show the agenda of the brand which was to help ladies get the glow of their skin back with Mavix Glow body cream.

								<br />

								<br />

								Click the button below if you want to get yourself a brand name that is memorable, smooth on the tongue and freshly packed with professional meaning.
