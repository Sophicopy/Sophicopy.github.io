<h2>The quickest way to get your name on Google</h2>


<p>
We all know that Google is one of most visited sites in the world.

I mean, it gets more than 2billion searches every single day!

If you could get your name on Google, imagine how famous you could be:

<b>1. </b> Any search on your name will show up with you as the first page.

<b>2. </b> Customers will get to know your products and services more easily without having to ask you questions.

Cause all they need to know is right there on Google.

<b>3. </b> You will stand out from the millions of people having the same name as you.

It's wonderful and I want to show you how to do it and do it right.

Oh, dear!

I forgot to introduce myself!

My name is Sophia Oladapo (which you can search on Google by the way).

I am a web developer (good at the front-end) with a year of experience in HTML, CSS and WordPress blogging.

(I even have my own site!)

With my experience I have built sites that are:

<b>mobile user-friendly, 

has simple design, is straight to the point... 

and also converts.</b>

I know they are responsive designs because they were virtually tested on more than 5 devices and...

Manually on four devices of different sizes.

The sites supports animations and they load fast.

You're getting tired, right?
I know, I know.

I'll get to the point soon enough.

Okay, so this is it.

<b>For you to get your name out there on Google, you need to have a page that Google recognises with your name in it.</b>

I know you're thinking, "So does that mean I must have a website?"

Nope, not at all.
Actually a simple Facebook account will do to get your name on Google.

Any social media site that Google recognises will do the work.

Ugh.

<b>"What happened?"</b>

That's the problem, you won't get to be seen on the first page because it's a social media site.

There are probably thousands or maybe hundreds of people having the same name as you.

Why should Google place your account as the first page when your name is the same as others?

</p>

<h2>But don't worry, there's another way.</h2>

<p>
You could get your name on Google using what is called <b>Google MyBusinessPage.</b>

Which I can help you create by the way.

It's a simple page that tells you the:

name of the business, 

a short description that tells you the category of the business,
 
the location and contact details. 

Which should be enough, right?

Enough to get your name as the first page that is seen when there's a Google search with your name.

And enough to get your contact details and a little information.

If you need help with creating it, you can send me a message.

Alright, but what if you want more than that?

Maybe you want people to know more than just your name and location and phone number.

For that, you will need a website.

A website will get your name out there on Google but it will also give your customers:

more information about what you do and 

why they should be your customers from you and not another.

Think of websites like <b>Groove Pages</b> or <b>ClickFunnels</b> or even <b>Wordpress</b>.

They tell you more than just their contact and name, right?

And they also enable you to speak directly with them and help you.

You can't create an account with ClickFunnels or WordPress from their Google MyBusinessPage, could you?

Websites do a lot more for you business than Google pages.

Which is why I specialise in creating websites and landing pages.

Check my website for more info:

And to show you that I practise what I preach.

You can search for Sophicopy on Google, the first page you'll see is:

my Google MyBusinesPage, 
then my website.

See you there,
From Your Web Developer,
Sophia Oladapo
