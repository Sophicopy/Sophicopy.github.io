						How Did We Come To Be?

						<div class="mission">
							<div class="mission-text">Surprisingly the idea of Sophicopy wasn't as a result of a research nor was it carefully planned.

It came suddenly when I needed to write a landing page copy for a digital product I wanted to sell.
		
I realized I didn't have a business name yet so I created one.
And with that Sophicopy was born.

			Here's the full story

			<div class="mission">
				<div class="mission-text">In August 2021, I received a text message from my elder sister.
        
She told me about her decision to enroll me in an online whatsapp class where I could learn a skill called copywriting.
        
I was a bit annoyed cause then I just got started in this business world.
        
I had a lot of free classes I joined that needed my attention.
        
But I had no other choice cause my sister made used of her own money to pay the fee for me.

Towards the end of the class we were given a project to do that will help in testing our skills and getting better.

I did my project at the last minute but it still yielded some results and I got some people to buy what I sold.

So while I was doing the project, I thought I needed a professional business name.
And it came easily to me though - the name Sophicopy.

			How The Name "Sophicopy" <br>Was Created
			<div class="mission">
				<div class="mission-text">
Like I said in the homepage, I create brand names and it really comes easy to me, more like my second nature.

Example of some of the names I created are:
Sophicopy, Sophi-Info, Mavix Glow, Medivo, Health Med Hub and many others.
					
I hardly think too much about it, but the one name that I and my graphic designer researched so much about before creating was a very special work.
					
The name was Mavix Glow.

But not to take too much of your time, let me do a brief summary of how I got the name - Sophicopy.

I just sat down and thought of what name to use, I decided to try out a brand name created from cut-out parts of a name.

So I cut out the "a" part of my name Sophia and added "copy" gotten from copywriting, joined both of them together.

And voila we have a brand new brand name.
